              In this work we combined kinetic studies for aqueous-phase glucose oxidation in a high-pressure autoclave setup with catalyst reoxidation studies in a liquid-core waveguide membrane reactor. Hereby, we investigated the influence of Nb- and Ta-doping on Mo-based Keggin-polyoxometalates for both reaction steps independently. Most importantly, we could demonstrate a significant increase of glucose oxidation kinetics by Ta- and especially Nb-doping by factors of 1.1 and 1.5 compared to the classical HPA-Mo. Moreover, activation energies for the substrate oxidation step could be significantly reduced from around 80 kJ mol
              −1
              for the classical HPA-Mo to 61 kJ mol
              −1
              for the Ta- and 55 kJ mol
              −1
              for the Nb-doped species, respectively. Regarding catalyst reoxidation kinetics, the doping did not show significant differences between the different catalysts.},

          , 
            
              The stoichiometric dehydration of glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) converts an abundant substrate to a versatile chemical. HMF formation can be optimised by using suitable solvents including ionic liquids and DMSO, and by cosolvents such as water. A prerequisite for efficient glucose influx into pathways to HMF is the isomerization of glucose to a ketose, typically the Lewis acid catalysed conversion to fructose. Here, solvent control of the influx of glucose into pathways to HMF is mapped through isotope tracing assays and through kinetic
              in situ
              observations. Diversions from the path to HMF in the presence of water are described for the popular CrCl
              3
              /DMSO system. Addition of water to this system favors the formation of a useful byproduct instead of a mixture of inert compounds. The water-enabled formation of this product is observed for a variety of catalytsts and solvents.},

          , 
            
              We use infrared (IR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in multistage dissolution experiments in various solvents to investigate the solubility and molecular structure of humins formed during fructose dehydration. We demonstrate that the soluble fraction of humins correlates positively with the donor number of solvents resulting in significant dissolution at room temperature in solvents with high donor number. Most of the solubilized humins fragments have relatively low molecular weight (
              M
              w
              ), and the same species are present in different quantities as the residual solid is repeatedly dissolved in the same solvent. In contrast to the common belief of humins consisting of polymers of large
              M
              w
              , we postulate for the first time that they are spatially and chemically heterogeneous and consist of insoluble macromolecules and small soluble species that are weakly associated within the structure. The solubility profiles of dissolved species in acetonitrile and methanol are different in terms of
              M
              w
              but possess similar IR spectra, indicative of similar functional groups in dissolved species. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the identified humins fragments form through aldol condensation between 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and its hydrated products and through condensation of furanic species.},

	abstract = {Conversion of biomass waste to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a value-added platform chemical, has captured great research interests driven by the economic and environmental incentives. This review evaluates the recent development of biomass conversion systems for high HMF yield and selectivity, with a focus on the performance of emerging catalysts and solvents from a mechanistic view. We highlight that the ratio and strength of Brønsted and Lewis acid in bifunctional catalyst are critical for maximizing HMF production by selective improvement in the kinetics of desirable reactions (hydrolysis, isomerization, and dehydration) over undesirable reactions (rehydration, polymerization). The characteristics of solvent mixture such as functional groups and speciation govern the reactivity of substrate towards desirable reactions and stability of HMF and intermediates against side reactions. Research efforts to unravel the interactions among co-catalysts/co-solvents and between catalysts and solvents are encouraged, thereby engineering a synergistic conversion system for biomass valorization.},

Even though HMF synthesis holds promise for a greener future, the current state of technology and the high production cost limit its competitiveness on an industrial scale. In this prospect, we have developed a multigram-scale procedure for HMF by reacting d-fructose with Purolite CT275DR-an acidic resin-in a dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/tetraethyl ammonium bromide (TEAB) biphasic system. Reactions performed in an autoclave for 2 h at 110 °C using up to 40 gram of d-fructose resulted in an overall HMF yield of 70\%. HMF was purified by a custom-made procedure leading to ca 50\% of the pure crystalline product; meanwhile, the residual HMF-rich oil was directly reduced to bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). Green metrics and the Ecoscale algorithm were used to evaluate the sustainability of the herein-proposed procedure in comparison with previously reported works.},

	abstract = {Humins waste valorization is considered to be an essential pathway to improve the economic viability of many biorefinery processes and further promote their circularity by avoiding waste formation. In this research, the incorporation of humins in a Diels-Alder (DA) polymer network based on furan-maleimide thermoreversible crosslinks was studied. A considerable enhancement of the healing efficiency was observed by just healing for 1 h at 60 °C at the expense of a reduction of the material mechanical properties, while the unfilled material showed no healing under the same conditions. Nevertheless, the thermal healing step favored the irreversible humins polycondensation, thus strengthening the material while keeping the enhanced healing performance. Our hypothesis states a synergistic healing mechanism based on humins flowing throughout the damage, followed by thermal humins crosslinking during the healing trigger, together with DA thermoreversible bonds recombination. A multi-material soft robotic gripper was manufactured out of the proposed material, showing not only improved recovery of the functional performance upon healing but also stiffness-tunable features by means of humins thermal crosslinking. For the first time, both damage healing and zone reinforcement for further damage prevention are achieved in a single intrinsic self-healing system.},

	abstract = {The necessity of more sustainable conditions that follow the twelve principles of Green Chemistry have pushed researchers to the development of novel reagents, catalysts and solvents for greener asymmetric methodologies. Solvents are in general a fundamental part for developing organic processes, as well as for the separation and purification of the reaction products. By this reason, in the last years, the application of the so-called green solvents has emerged as a useful alternative to the classical organic solvents. These solvents must present some properties, such as a low vapor pressure and toxicity, high boiling point and biodegradability, and must be obtained from renewable sources. In the present revision, the recent application of these biobased solvents in the synthesis of optically active compounds employing different catalytic methodologies, including biocatalysis, organocatalysis and metal catalysis, will be analyzed to provide a novel tool for carrying out more ecofriendly organic processes.},
